Kubernetes (K8s) – Introduction
What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, commonly known as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It helps you deploy, manage, scale, and operate containerized applications efficiently.
In simple terms, Kubernetes takes care of running your containers reliably in production environments.

Why Kubernetes?

As applications grow, managing containers manually becomes complex. Kubernetes solves this by providing:

#Automated deployment and updates
#Auto-scaling of applications based on load
#Self-healing (restarts failed containers)
#Load balancing and service discovery
#High availability for applications

Key Kubernetes Concepts:

#Cluster: A set of machines (nodes) that run containerized applications
#Node: A worker machine in the cluster
#Pod: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (one or more containers)
#Service: Exposes applications running in pods
#Deployment: Manages application updates and scaling
#Namespace: Logical separation of resources
#Where is Kubernetes Used?

Kubernetes is widely used for:

#Microservices architectures
#Cloud-native applications
#CI/CD pipelines
#High-traffic web applications
#Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments
